## Demos

### Data Visualizer
Change Directories to the correct folder:
```bash
cd ./EITPose/src/data_visualizer
```
Run the Visualizer:
```bash
python DataComparator.py
```
Select "Load File" and choose the desired data file to visualize (see "Available Datasets" below).\
Hit the "Play" button or move the slider timeline to examine the data changing over time.

### Evaluation
Change Directories to the evaluation folder:
```bash
cd ./EITPose/src/analysis/evaluation
```
Run one of the evaluations. For example to evaluate the Mean Per Joint Positional Error (MPJPE) within session:
```bash
python experiment_mpjpe_within_session.py
```
Outputs will be saved to EITPose/src/analysis/evaluation/experiment_results/


## Available Datasets
- EITPose/src/data/processed_pose_data: EIT/hand pose within sessions, across sessions, across users
- EITPose/src/data/processed_longitudinal_data: EIT/hand pose within sessions across a long period of time
- EITPose/src/data/processed_gesture_data: EIT/hand gesture within sessions and across users

### Models
No models have been uploaded because they are quite large for certain experiment configurations. However, the given experiments can produce the models by setting the "save_model" parameter to True and running the experiment.

## System Requirements
This was written in python3 (3.8.16) using sci-kit learning as the main ML libraries. This was developed in a Windows environment, but should run in Mac and Linux too. The environment.yml file here can be used to initialize a conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
\
If you are not using Anaconda, you can also use pip to install the required python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

abstract = {Real-time hand pose estimation has a wide range of applications spanning gaming, robotics, and human-computer interaction. In this paper, we introduce EITPose, a wrist-worn, continuous 3D hand pose estimation approach that uses eight electrodes positioned around the forearm to model its interior impedance distribution during pose articulation. Unlike wrist-worn systems relying on cameras, EITPose has a slim profile (12 mm thick sensing strap) and is power-efficient (consuming only 0.3 W of power), making it an excellent candidate for integration into consumer electronic devices. In a user study involving 22 participants, EITPose achieves with a within-session mean per joint positional error of 11.06 mm. Its camera-free design prioritizes user privacy, yet it maintains cross-session and cross-user accuracy levels comparable to camera-based wrist-worn systems, thus making EITPose a promising technology for practical hand pose estimation.},
